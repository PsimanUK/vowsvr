# VOWS VR
## A Virtual Reality Videography Business

### Purpose
This website is being developed as part of my PHP study. The intention is to have a fully functioning site that will allow the showcasing of VR video content and the ability for a user to book a consultation to discuss a wedding that they would like to be recorded in 360 degree 3D with spatial audio.

Once the initial website has been created, it is my further intention to have it fully accessible via a VR-capable browser with a head mounted display. 

### Technology
This site is being created using HTML5, CSS3 and PHP7. The first version will be made without an additional PHP framework but I plan to explore PHP frameworks as I become more familiar with the language.
